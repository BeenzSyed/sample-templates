Examples
================
The templates in this repository are for illustration, demonstration, and example purposes only. 
While you may want to refer to these examples when learning how to write your own templates, be aware that these templates may not capture best-practice application or resource topology configurations and serve as examples only. Refer to the product documentation at http://docs.rackspace.com for the most up-to-date and supported template syntax.

While we make effort to maintain these examples, they are are not tested for production purposes and should be used with caution.
